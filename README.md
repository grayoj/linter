# linter
My default config for eslint in React CRA projects.

## Steps
<b>Step 1</b>
```npm install -D eslint```
To Install all Eslint as a developer dependency.

<b>Step 2</b>
```npm install -D eslint-plugin-import eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y eslint-plugin-react```
To install all required dependencies.

<b>Step 3</b>
Download the .eslintrc.json file and move into your directory. Or Copy and paste.

## Thank You
Planning on making the linter config an npm package to easily set up.
